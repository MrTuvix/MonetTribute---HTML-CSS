        <ul>
          <li>
            Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the fifth floor of 45
            rue Laffitte, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine
            Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians.
          </li>
          <li>
            On 20 May 1841, he was baptized in the local parish church,
            Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, as Oscar-Claude, but his parents called him
            simply Oscar. Despite being baptized Catholic, Monet later became
            an atheist.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1845, his family moved to Le Havre in Normandy. His father
            wanted him to go into the family's ship-chandling and grocery
            business, but Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a
            singer, and supported Monet's desire for a career in art.
          </li>
          <li>
            On 1 April 1851, Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the
            arts. Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures, which he
            would sell for ten to twenty francs. Monet also undertook his
            first drawing lessons from Jacques-François Ochard, a former
            student of Jacques-Louis David.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1856 he met fellow artist Eugène Boudin, who became his mentor
            and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet "en plein
            air " (outdoor) techniques for painting. Both received the
            influence of Johan Barthold Jongkind.
          </li>
          <li>
            On 28 January 1857, when Monet was sixteen, his mother died. He
            left school and went to live with his widowed, childless aunt,
            Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.
          </li>
          <li>From the late 1860s, Monet and other like-minded artists met with rejection from the conservative
            Académie des Beaux-Arts, which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris.</li>
          <li>During the latter part of 1873, Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Alfred Sisley
            organized the Anonymous Society of Painters,
            Sculptors, and Engravers to exhibit their artworks independently.</li>
